# favoredthings
Some of the website files for "Favored Things", created in the 1990s to create content at the same time I was learning how to build websites. Yes, I've been making websites since the dawn of the internet. "Favored Things" has been a pleasant diversion and opportunity to play with new ideas and tools. However, my paid work for clients has taken most of my time. Navigation is being overhauled for modern standards (Stephanie Eckles, Andrew Roselli, etc). Also working on accessibility. 
Many other changes in the pipeline.
