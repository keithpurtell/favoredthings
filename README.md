# favoredthings
Some of the website files for "favored things", created in the 1990s to create content at the same time I was learning how to build websites. Yes, I've been making websites since the dawn of the internet. This has usually been a pleasant diversion and opportunity to play with new ideas and tools. However, my paid work for clients has taken so much time that I've neglected Favord Things. Navigation is being overhauled for modern standards (Stephanie Eckles, Andrew Roselli, etc). 
Many other changes in the pipeline.
